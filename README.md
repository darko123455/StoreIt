#StoreIt

Project for Informational System Development course at University of Belgrade Faculty of Mathematics. It's meant to be a storage manager app. It would allow managers/administrators to manage storage units on multiple sites, monitor what is stored in which storage unit and generate reports and receipts accordingly. On the other side it allows normal users that want to store their belongings to do just that. They can either store it immediately or make an reservation on the storage unit of their choice.
